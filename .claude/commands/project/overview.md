description: Bootstrap docs/narrative/ human-readable narrative tree from a fresh repository
argument-hint: <path> [branch-name]
---

Bootstrap the human-readable narrative tree under `docs/narrative/` of the working directory by exploring a fresh repository at `<path>`.

`<path>` is required and must be a local filesystem path. `[branch-name]` is optional and is recorded into output frontmatter; the user is responsible for checking out the branch before invoking this command.

1. Parse `<path>` (required) and `[branch-name]` (optional) from the slash-command args. If `<path>` is empty, error: `specify a local filesystem path, e.g. /project:overview C:\src\my-repo`.

2. If `<path>` matches `^https?://` or `^git@`, refuse with the literal one-line message `Remote URLs are not supported in v1. Pass a local filesystem path.` and stop — do not spawn the agent. (Remote URL support is deferred per analyze-workflow-project-explore.analyzed.md § 8 F3.)

3. Resolve `<path>` to an absolute filesystem path before spawning.

4. Spawn the `project-overview` subagent via the `Agent` tool with `description: "project-overview: bootstrap docs/narrative/"` and a `prompt` containing: the resolved absolute `<path>`, the `[branch-name]` arg if supplied (or the literal `null` if omitted), and the instruction that the agent must reload `.claude/skills/project-overview/SKILL.md` before any other action.

5. The subagent will execute its `## Operating procedure` (idempotency guard, skill load, repo walk, BC candidate surfacing, APPROVE gate, output generation, frontmatter recording) and produce the human-readable narrative tree under `docs/narrative/`.
