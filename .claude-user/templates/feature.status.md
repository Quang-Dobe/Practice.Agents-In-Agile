# <Feature title> - Status

**Last updated:** <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Current step:** Step <N> - <short title>

## Snapshot

One paragraph: where the feature is, what was delivered last session, what blocks the next step. Keep it under ~150 words; the SessionStart banner reads only the `Current step` and `Last updated` lines, so this paragraph is for humans who want full context.

Any cross-step facts that future sessions need (build environment quirks, repo-local config, external account notes). Keep ephemeral session diffs out - those go in `git log`.
